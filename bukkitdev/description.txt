== Troll 'Em  ==
Troll 'Em is a plugin that allows the server to troll it's players.
If the scheduler is set, the server will choose a random player
on a regular basis and apply a random troll to them (eg, tnt, entomb, name change, etc.)
Troll 'Em also allows players with sufficient permissions to use commands
to manually troll players, or set the scheduler to pick on certain players
without editing the config or restarting the plugin.
